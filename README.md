# Reactionyzer

#Welcome to Reactionyzer, the reaction time-based breathalyzer!

A traditional breathalyzer is not accurate and does not provide an accurate 
readout of how drunk a person is. Not only this it does not provide a measure
for other substances like weed. 

The device has two modes, field mode and car mode. Car mode is meant for use
in a persons car to test that they are not inebriated. Field mode is meant 
for use by a law enforcement officer to test a person that they have pulled
over. 

#Installation and Use Instructions:

	1: Turn on the device by plugging in a power source e.g. external battery. 
	2: Press the left and right buttons on the front of the device at the same
	   time to access the settings menu.
